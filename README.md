# The All-in-One Ad Production Kit (ADPK)

Everything you need to make Meta ads with Claude, Codex or any AI agent: skills and tools to go from
idea to ready-to-launch ad.

This is for people who make ads:
- Creative strategists
- copywriters
- video editors
- designers
- business owners
- etc

And can be used on your own or in collaboration.

Built on what I ([@oscarlorak](https://x.com/oscarlorak)) learned making ads for ecommerce brands:
7+ years, 2,000 ads and $20M+ in ad spend.

## What you can do with it

- **Image ads:** static ads with high product fidelity.
- **Scripts:** for creators to film, or for any video.
- **Podcast video ads:** clips of AI characters that feel taken from a long-form podcast.
- **Song video ads:** animated characters singing a relatable story while selling your product.
- **Animated video ads:** animated characters speaking or acting out your script, in Pixar,
  claymation or any animation style.
- **Slides video ads:** a narrated explainer, one illustrated slide per line.
- **UGC edits:** a creator's footage checked against the script, then cut into the ad.
- **Short recuts:** sub-30 s versions recombined from a finished talking-head or UGC edit.

## How it works

Everything runs through your agent: say what you want in plain words.

1. **Research:** *"Research Acme's greens powder."* The agent collects the brand's pages, reviews,
   Meta ads, what people post about it, its top 3 competitors and any files you share, then writes up
   the brand, each product, its customers (personas) and why they buy (angles), the competitors, and
   the brand's look.
2. **Concept:** *"Make an image ad for Acme"* — or a script, or a podcast, song, animated or
   slides video ad. The agent offers 3 different concepts (persona, angle, hook); you
   pick one.
3. **Write:** hooks, script and on-screen copy.
4. **Make:** the design or storyboard, then images, voices, music and video clips. You see and
   approve each step before the next.
5. **Edit:** clips, captions, music and effects are cut into the final video. You watch it in the
   studio and click on the video to leave notes; the agent applies them while you watch, then exports.
   A creator's footage is first checked against the script. A finished talking-head edit can be recut into shorter ads from the same footage.
6. **Review and upload:** *"Open the studio"* — the local web app: **Board** (review ads),
   **Media** (search the library), **Workflow** (each ad's progress, its brief to edit live, and its edit). Approved ads are uploaded to
   Google Drive, Notion, or anywhere you set up (e.g. Dropbox). Anything you or a client want
   remembered goes into the brand's memory, so the next ads follow it.

**Working solo:** everything stays on your computer. With cloud storage set up, say *"push Acme"*
when you finish to back it up.

**Working as a team:**

Teams share brands through cloud storage:

- At the start of every session: *"Update ADPK and pull Acme"* — the latest ADPK and the
  latest brand files. Updating never touches your brand work or `.env`.
- At the end of your work: *"Push Acme"*. The sync warns before overwriting someone's newer work.
- Share each workspace's `.env` block through a password vault, and propose ADPK changes as a
  pull request.

## How to set it up

ADPK works inside your AI agent: you talk to the agent, and it uses ADPK to make your ads.

1. **Open your AI agent.**
   - Claude: the **Code** tab of the [Claude app](https://claude.ai/download).
   - ChatGPT: the **Codex** tab of the [ChatGPT app](https://openai.com/chatgpt/download).
   - For others, it's the respective agent chat.
2. **Send it this message:** *Install https://github.com/oscarlora/ad-production-kit*

   Click **Allow** when it asks to run the install. On a Mac, if a window asks to install Apple's
   command line tools, click **Install**.
3. **Get your kie.ai key and paste it in the chat when the agent asks.** [kie.ai](https://kie.ai) is
   the one service ADPK needs: through a single account it runs every AI model ADPK uses to make
   images, video, voices, music and sound effects. You pay as you go, with credits.
   1. Sign up at [kie.ai](https://kie.ai).
   2. Add credits on its billing page.
   3. Open [API Keys](https://kie.ai/api-key), create a key and copy it.

Then say *"Let's make an ad for &lt;your brand's website&gt;"* or whatever you want to do.

*For the AI agent:* install with
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscarlora/ad-production-kit/main/tools/setup.sh | bash`
(on Windows, clone this repo and run `tools\setup.ps1`), then follow
[`skills/set-up-adpk/SKILL.md`](skills/set-up-adpk/SKILL.md) in the downloaded folder.

**Good to know**

- **Model:** on Claude, Opus 5.5 at medium effort (ADPK sets it for you); on ChatGPT, GPT-6.1 Sol at
  medium. For any other agent, use its top model at its recommended effort.
- **What the install adds:** ADPK itself, Node (runs ADPK's tools), ffmpeg (video and audio
  processing), whisper.cpp (word timings for captions), git (on a Mac, through Apple's command line
  tools), and the catalog of a shared library of music, sound effects and references (each file
  downloads when an ad uses it). Everything but git goes in your user folder, with no admin
  password.
- **Optional, for teams or cloud storage:** a [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/)
  bucket keeps your brand files in the cloud and lets a team share them. Without it, everything stays
  on your computer. Google Drive and Notion uploads are optional too.
- ADPK runs on macOS, Windows and Linux.

## How it's organized

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — the rules every agent reads first
- `skills/` — step-by-step procedures, one folder per skill
- `tools/` — the scripts the agent runs (each has `--help`)
- `studio/` — the local web app
- `workspaces/` — your brands, never committed; local, or synced to the workspace's R2 bucket
