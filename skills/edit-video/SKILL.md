description: Assemble and revise a video ad in ADPK's own editor — an edit document (outputs/<ad>/edit.json) that Studio previews live and tools/edit-video.mjs exports to MP4 with the same engine. Use when cutting rendered clips into a finished video, adding the hook, captions, music, sound effects, transitions, zooms, color or an end card, applying the user's review notes from Studio, or exporting ("tighten the pacing", "fade between these", "grade them to match", "duck the music", "export it").

# Edit video

An ad's edit is one JSON document, `outputs/<ad>/edit.json`. A version that changes only the hook
(`edit-v2.json`, `edit-v3.json`…) holds just its hook on top of `"base": "edit.json"`, so body changes
happen once, in `edit.json`; one that differs more (a reframe, **recut-shorts**) is a full copy.
Editing marks the ad as yours until you push (sync-brand). Studio's Workflow page shows it live in
the ad's **Edit** step: preview, timeline, review notes and an Export button. Change the document
(or replace a media file it uses) and the preview follows within a second. Schema, flags and every subcommand: `node tools/edit-video.mjs --help`.

## Build

1. **Gather:** clips in `clips/` (a creator's footage in `footage/`, checked by **review-ugc-footage**), voiceover, music (**add-music**), sound effects (**generate-sfx**),
   product graphics (**search-media**). The preview loads a file the moment the document names it: finish new media
   (write it under a temp name, then rename it) before pointing the document at it.
2. **Write the document:** tracks top to bottom (hook and text, captions, video, voice, music, SFX),
   every time on the timeline clock. Clips trim with `in`, play at `rate` and get `transition`s.
   Anything that changes over time (zoom, volume, saturation…) takes keyframes.
3. **Captions:** `captions --words <transcript or song timing>` writes word-timed lines (**caption-video**).
4. **Check:** `check`, and `frames --at …` when you need to see a moment.

## Revise: live review

The user can also trim clips in Studio, which writes straight into the document: change an edit in place from
then on, never rebuild it from a script over their trims.

The user leaves notes on the preview (a moment, optionally a box on the frame). Work through them as
they come:

1. `node tools/edit-video.mjs comments outputs/<ad> --wait` as a tracked background command with no
   time limit: it exits with the open notes the moment there is one, with a contact sheet of their
   moments (the rest, and `--take`: `--help`).
2. Look at the sheet: the box says which word, face or object the note means. Make each change on
   what it's about: a clip's look on the clip (it then starts and ends with it), keyframes only for
   change over time, timed to cuts or word times, never by ear.
3. When a change moves or retimes something (a cut, a keyframe, a position), check one `frames`
   sheet for the whole batch at the first and last frame of each change and just outside it. A
   change of wording, color or volume needs no sheet. A change to what's heard: `audio --from --to
   --transcribe` on the changed stretch, never an export.
4. `comments outputs/<ad> --done <id> --reply "<what changed, in a few words>" --span <from>-<to>`
   (the changed stretch, which Studio's watch button plays). The user watches it and approves it,
   which moves it to the note history, or leaves a new note.
5. Start the wait again.

Notes are one file each in `outputs/<ad>/comments/`, in the language the user writes in; reply in it.
A note on a brief (.md) or `footage.json` has `file` and `quote` (the text it's about) instead of a
moment; its `--done` takes no `--span` (and on a brief, a `--reply` only when you changed something).
One from the user's own edit in Studio carries `edit: { where, from, to }`: bring what depends on it
in step.

## Pick the style

For talking-head or UGC footage, settle this first:

- **Retention** (the default for UGC talking heads) — footage that isn't engaging on its own. Every
  edit has to earn watch time: stacked lists, slapped words, a tracked highlighter on the label,
  zooms and sound effects. No music unless asked.
- **Plain ("yapper")** — the person or footage already holds attention. Hook text and captions only;
  no music (the clip runs continuous, often with its own native sound). A zoom only where it helps,
  never where it breaks the raw, organic feel.

## What to reach for

Work in this order, since each step shifts the timing of the ones after it: clips and fixes,
`tighten`, speed (UGC speech plays at 1.15×, every time on the timeline rescaled with it), overlays
and zooms, sound effects. A hook version (`edit-v2.json`…) owns its hook clips: copy V1's opening
settings into it (the push-out, the whoosh's trim, the hook text's position) and recheck after each
change to V1's.

- **Cuts and pacing** — shots on the voiceover's lines (`place`); `cut` removes a stretch (a pause,
  a line) from every track and closes the gap, captions and keyframes included. For a real speaker
  (UGC, talking head), `tighten` takes out every breath, lead-in and pause by waveform, guarded by the
  words; run it once the takes are placed, and again after any retake.
- **B-roll** — never a flash of the talking head under ~0.7 s between two B-roll shots (extend the
  B-roll instead), no jump cut inside a B-roll shot under ~0.8 s, and no one in it visibly talking.
  Slow a shot down to use only the moment that fits. Check every product shot for a mirrored label
  (**review-ugc-footage**) as you place it.
- **Transitions** — UGC: hard cuts, anything else only on request. Otherwise `transition` on the
  incoming clip: fade for a mood shift, slide, push or wipe for a jump in place or time.
- **Zooms** — plan them all before keyframing any: list the key phrases with their times, then give
  each shot one move, checking the shots on either side so moves alternate: still, a slow push-in
  (~1.06 across the shot; suits a question that builds tension), or a fast hit (in ~0.1 s) on the
  start of a key *phrase* of 2–5 words, held to the cut. A hit needs about a second before the cut,
  else it snaps back and reads as a glitch; a zoom-out happens only on a cut, never mid-shot. A
  phrase that names a motion ("up and down") can take a literal camera move: frame that shot a little
  tighter from its first frame so the move has room without a visible zoom. Keyframe `scale` with an
  `origin` on the subject, on one clip or on the track's `transform` across cuts. None during an
  on-screen list; text never rides a zoom.
- **Tracking** — a zoom or overlay on something that moves (a label, a jar, a hand) follows it
  frame by frame: `track --clip <name> --at <t> --box x,y,w,h`, with `--follow` for the overlays and
  `--zoom` to zoom the clip onto it.
- **Open and close on a move** — open on a fast push-out (1.2 → 1.0 in ~0.2 s, `ease`), its fastest
  moment on the whoosh's peak; close on a fast zoom (~3×, `track --zoom`) onto the product after the
  last word, centered and above the badge, the offer coming in once the zoom clears the face.
- **Color** — `match` grades every clip toward the median look (`--ref` toward one clip); `grade`
  takes exposure, contrast, saturation, temperature, grain, vignette, each keyframable.
- **Sound** — you choose it: music (**add-music**) and effects (**generate-sfx**); reference a shared
  library file in place (`../../../../Shared/Library/inputs/media/<file>`). An effect earns its place by marking something (a
  move, a reveal, a list item), never as decoration. Time each effect from its peak (**generate-sfx**, Place). `duck` dips a track under speech (`--speaker`
  for one voice in a transcript); `moves` lists where the picture moves, for effects on actions.
  A noisy or mumbled voice: **generate-voice** (`isolate`, `patch`).
- **Text** — hook, lists and end card as `text` / `rect` / `image` clips. Everything sits where both
  feeds show it: inside the 4:5 crop (y 285–1635 on 1920) and above the Reels UI, which covers the
  bottom ~35% (so no text below y ~1250), with room to spare — about 90 px from every edge, text
  blocks at most ~880 px wide — and clear of the face and the product. Captions stay centered
  in one spot; while the product is held they may shift only up or down, inside the safe zone, and
  overlap it when it can't be cleared. Other on-screen text replaces the captions for its whole
  sentence (**caption-video**, Hook). When the speaker lists things, stack them: one line per item with an
  emoji, in on its word with a soft ding, held to the cut. Small print
  (a results disclaimer) shows only beside the claim it covers, never in the hook, and none in a
  first-person story.
- **Short cuts** — more ads from the same footage, under 30 s: **recut-shorts**.
- **Other placements** — `reframe --size 1080x1350` (4:5) or `1080x1080` into a new version, then
  check its text on a `frames` sheet.
- **Motion graphics and anything else** — the ad's own `fx.js` (custom layers, transitions, animations;
  the contract is in `studio/engine/draw.js`), one file with no imports (Studio loads it alone). A layer
  animates with `env.motion`: `timeline(c, t, build)` for a GSAP timeline, `three(ctx, c, t, env, setup)` for
  a Three.js scene in the clip's box. Both are posed for the exact frame, so the preview follows a save
  within a second and the export matches; check moments with `frames`. Something a second ad needs moves
  into the engine.

## Export

The Studio preview is the live edit, so review and revisions never need an export. Export only when the user
asks or approves the cut. Push to R2 only when the user says the editing is done, and after reopening it, only on their
next "done". `node tools/edit-video.mjs export outputs/<ad>/edit.json` (or the user's Export button): H.264 + AAC at
−14 LUFS into `final/<id>_V<n>_…mp4`, about 20 s for 80 s of 1080p; `--out` names it per the brand's
brief template if it has one. `--scale 0.5` makes a quick draft,
`--from`/`--to` a section. Never grade your own render; hand over the path.

With R2, final cuts are heavy files a plain push skips: push with
`node tools/sync-brand.mjs --push workspaces/<WS>/<Brand> --originals`.
