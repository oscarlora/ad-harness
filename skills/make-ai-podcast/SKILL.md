# Make AI podcast

A podcast-style video ad: one to four people talking, one on screen at a time, straight cuts.
**Seedance 2.5** generates the footage and the voices; **GPT Image 2.5** locks each speaker's look in
a base image first. Any length, any language: longer just means more clips (step 8).

## 1. Research

Load the brand context (AGENTS.md) and any client brief in `inputs/`, then pass **write-copy**'s
claims gate (the persona and angle come from step 2).

## 2. Concept

Settle each element in order; skip any the brief or the user already set.

- **Product** — usually set by step 1's gate.
- **Persona** and **angle** — from `-personas.md` and `-angles.md`; ideate fresh ones when none
  fits (**ideate-personas-angles**).
- **Target market** — sets the voices' **accent** (US → American, UK → British) and the script's
  **language, idioms and phrasing**.
- **Format variation** — a one-, two-, three-, or four-person show.

## 3. Characters

Per speaker: age, ethnicity, look, outfit, and a **detailed voice design** (checklist in
**generate-voice**).

Make the voices **clearly contrasting** (a low, warm alto against a bright, airy mezzo): Seedance
builds the voices from this text, and similar descriptions blur into one voice.

## 4. Set

Generate the **podcast-set photo** with **write-prompt** (`tools/generate-image.mjs`, 9:16 at 1K,
three rolls; save the pick as `base/set.png`). Options vary the vibe (backdrop, light, props) to
fit the brand and persona. Use a real set photo only when the brand owns one the user wants
(**search-media**); never adapt a photo of someone else's show.

The prompt asks for:

- **One stand-in person seated**, framed from the waist up, angled a little off-camera as if
  mid-conversation (step 5 replaces them).
- **A boom-arm podcast mic** entering from the lower left toward the mouth, never covering the face.
- **No text, logo or show name** anywhere, on the mic or the set.
- **A paused frame of real interview footage**, not a render, in **write-prompt**'s photography
  direction. If the set looks AI-generated, the video will too.

Give each speaker their own **facing** so intercut singles read as one conversation. The second
speaker uses a flipped copy (`ffmpeg -i set.png -vf hflip set-flipped.png`): mic on the other side,
facing the other way. With three or four speakers, keep assigning facings and mic sides in that same
geometry; a one-person show skips this.

## 5. Base-image prompts

One base image per character: an image-to-image edit of their set photo (the second speaker's is the
`-flipped` copy). The prompt is a **pure edit-instruction list**: only the changes you want.

- **Don't describe the set photo** — describing it invites redrawing. **No meta-words**: never
  "photorealistic", "fictional", or any realism or retouch language, and never "soft" (it triggers
  retouched skin).
- **Replace the person with the designed character** (step 3), writing imperfections in as character
  detail: visible pores, slightly uneven skin tone with faint redness, subtle under-eye shadows, sun
  freckles, peach fuzz, flyaways and baby hairs.
- **Wardrobe, pose, framing, and expression** per the character design, angled to match their set
  photo's facing.
- **No text anywhere**: no show name or logo on the mic or set.
- **End with the lock:** add fine sensor noise like a paused frame of real interview footage; keep
  the photo's texture, natural skin texture, grain, contrast, and pixel-level detail exactly the
  same — only replace the person and apply the edits listed. Keep everything else exactly the same.

## 6. Generate the base images

Per character, run the same prompt **three times**, 9:16 at 1K, with that speaker's set photo as
`--ref`:

```
node tools/generate-image.mjs \
  --prompt-file workspaces/<WS>/<Brand>/outputs/<ad-name>/base/<character>.txt \
  --ref workspaces/<WS>/<Brand>/outputs/<ad-name>/base/set.png \
  --aspect 9:16 --resolution 1K \
  --out workspaces/<WS>/<Brand>/outputs/<ad-name>/base/<character>-a.png
```

Roll `-a`/`-b`/`-c`; the second speaker's `--ref` is the `-flipped` copy. Keep `--out` under
`workspaces/<WS>/…` (the tool picks the workspace's keys from it). If no roll lands, tighten the
prompt and reroll.

## 7. Script

Write a very casual, speech-like conversation from the signed-off claims and the research doc's
customer language. Cover these **beats**, merged or reordered as feels natural: the hook exchange ·
the problem in the guest's lived words · what they tried that didn't work · what actually works, said
simply and hedged like a layperson · the result, with a number and a timeframe (signed-off claims
only) · the after, a scene from their week now · the product, named naturally near the end.

Options each open on a different beat (the result, the problem, what they tried). Agree the target
length with the user. Writing, claim and dialogue rules live in **write-copy**; load it. The product
graphic goes on in the edit: write the dialogue so nothing needs to be shown.

## 8. Video prompts

Split the script into consecutive clips within the model's per-clip cap (**write-prompt**, Video
models); round each clip's length up to a whole second. Time each clip at **write-copy**'s pace
(Length), counting every speaker's words. If a render drags, drop its duration by a second rather
than cutting words; if it rushes, cut words rather than adding seconds.

**Hand off between clips.** End a clip mid-thought, on a line the speaker is about to continue, and
open the next mid-sentence with that speaker already talking and moving.

Make each prompt **fully self-contained**: restate every character, the set, and which reference
image is which; never reference another clip.

Lay each prompt out in Seedance's syntax (**write-prompt**, Writing for each model), with these
labeled blocks:

- **TASK** — bring lines X–Y to life, vertical 9:16. Use each character's base image exactly as
  their keyframe: do not redraw, restyle, recrop, relight, or change the set, wardrobe, faces, or
  composition. Locked-off camera, static the whole clip. Only the
  person on screen moves, in micro-movements: a natural blink rate, collarbone breathing, head
  moves of a centimeter or two, small low hand moves — nothing theatrical. Simple hard straight cuts
  between lines, one person on screen at a time; each cut lands on the second the incoming line
  starts, with that speaker already in subtle motion (mid-breath, mid-nod). Cut only when the
  other person actually speaks (a genuine question or interjection); reactions stay off screen.
  Consecutive lines from the same speaker run as one continuous locked shot, never a jump cut.
- **AUDIO** — the audio policy, then the voices plus natural sound (soft breaths before and after lines, a
  chair creak, fabric near the mic); room tone runs unbroken across every cut. Brisk pacing, no dead
  air — each line begins on the tail of the previous one. Hold each voice exactly consistent.
- **VOICES** — step 3's voice-design block, **verbatim and identical in every clip**, saying which
  character is which.
- **SHOTS** — per line: who is on screen, their exact expression and gesture, and the exact spoken
  line, timed in seconds (`3-6s:`) with the line as `MAYA's line (amused): {…}`. **Anchor each beat
  to a second**, never to a word: the palm turns up at 4s, the
  eyes drop at 5s. Expressions move **with** the words and relax as the line ends — never hold, grow, or freeze a
  smile after a line; end every shot mid-energy. State once that **no gesture, sound, or expression
  repeats anywhere in the clip**. Cue interruptions (cut off mid-word) with the barging-in voice
  starting a beat before the cut — the one exception to cutting where the line starts.
- **REACTIONS** — for **both** people: whoever is off screen reacts under the other's lines (a soft
  "mhm", a small laugh, a breath, a chair creak), each at the second it lands on. Write it
  rich; never skip it.

Keep prompts tight, per **write-prompt**'s "How a model reads a prompt". Spend the words on the
micro-gestures, micro-sounds and micro-movements in **SHOTS** and on **REACTIONS**.

## 9. Generate the video

Once the user approves the clip prompts, one run per clip:

```
node tools/generate-video.mjs \
  --prompt-file <clip>.txt \
  --image <host-base>.png --image <guest-base>.png \
  --model seedance-2.5 \
  --aspect 9:16 --duration <within the model's cap> \
  --out workspaces/<WS>/<Brand>/outputs/<ad-name>/clips/<clip>.mp4 --timeout 600
```

- `--image`: the base image of each character who speaks in that clip.
- Sound stays on (no `--no-audio`); the audio policy rules out music.
- **Always pass `--model seedance-2.5`**.
- Check each clip silently with `ffprobe` (duration, streams, audio present); no frame pulls unless
  the user asks.

## 10. Finish

The clips carry no music and no on-screen product; both go in during the edit. Two routes:

- **Self-edit in ADPK.** Load **edit-video** and build the cut as an edit document: the clips
  in order, the product graphic at the beat that fits (**search-media**), captions and music as
  wanted (**caption-video**, **add-music**).
- **Hand off to an editor:** **write-handoff** (Editor handoff).

Record, index and R2 push: AGENTS.md (a final cut rendered here: **edit-video**, Export).

## Naming

Format `Podcast` in **write-prompt**'s naming convention, e.g.
`7_V1_Kitchen-Table-Talk_Podcast_Busy-Parent_Reframe_Acme`.
