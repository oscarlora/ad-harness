# Studio design

How Studio looks. Values live once, as variables in `:root` of `app/globals.css`; this file names
them and says how to use them. Sections follow the DESIGN.md format
(github.com/google-labs-code/design.md).

## Overview

A quiet tool for reviewing ads. The ads carry the color; the interface stays out of their way:
warm white, near-black text, hairlines, one font. Structure is felt rather than seen. Dense and
calm, built for scanning many ads fast.

## Colors

- Surfaces: `--bg` content · `--bg-subtle` viewer stage and empty frames · `--fill` segmented-control
  tracks and hover · `--fill-soft` the editor timeline's track bands · `--fill-strong` pressed and timeline clips · `--media-bg` behind media ·
  `--glass` the translucent white of bars and controls floating over media
- Text: `--fg` primary (`--fg-hover` on the primary button) · `--muted-emphasis` body in tables and
  panels · `--muted` labels and meta · `--faint` placeholders, to-do steps, hollow dots, waveforms ·
  `--on-media` text and marks over media
- Lines: `--line` dividers and table rules · `--line-strong` hover borders and empty dots
- Status, only as 7px dots, never as fills: `--success` Approved / done, `--info` Pending Review /
  current, `--warning` errors. In Progress is a hollow dot.
- Video stages sit on `--stage` (pure black). The only solid dark fill is the primary button.

## Typography

- Inter only (`--font-sans`), weights 400, 500, 600. Body 14px, line height 1.55.
- Scale: `--text-xs` 12 labels, meta and dense marks (`.eyebrow`, timeline, key hints) · `--text-sm`
  13 controls, tables, panels · `--text-md` 14 body and prose (the page default) · `--text-lg` 16
  names · `--text-2xl` 24 page titles.
- 400 body · 500 labels, buttons, hooks · 600 headings and names. Headings track -0.015em to -0.02em.
- Tabular numbers for IDs, times and counts. Sentence case everywhere; slugs shown as words.
- Headings balance, paragraphs wrap pretty.

## Layout

- Pages pad by `--page-pad` (20px). Every brand page has a rail on the left as wide as the top bar is tall
  (`--bar-h`: the brand picker, then the pages as icons, no text) and one bar on top, both on `--bg-subtle` for the page's own controls: its count on the left, search centered, filters and actions
  on the right, each filter and the sort a dropdown led by a muted icon, the sort last; Board, Media and the Workflow
  list share this order (filters "Any …", sort Newest / Oldest). An ad's page puts back, ID and name, and the step tabs (names only) in that bar; its editor keeps the timeline
  fixed at the bottom, with the preview and notes filling the space above (preview and notes on `--bg-subtle`,
  the timeline on `--fill`).
- The Board and the media library are masonry grids: 4 columns from 1200px, 3 from 900, 2 from
  640, else 1; each item keeps its own shape. The Workflow list caps at 64rem, centered; prose caps
  at 46rem.
- Long text (prompts, persona detail, Meta copy) lives in the viewer's side panel, not in lists.
- Spacing steps of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32px. Grids use `auto-fill`.
- Under 900px the editor and viewer narrow.

## Elevation & Depth

Mostly flat. Buttons and cards are drawn with `--shadow-border` (a hairline plus a trace of
shadow), which darkens on hover (`--shadow-border-hover`). Things floating over content — the
hover preview, the note composer, the toast, play buttons — use `--shadow-float`.
A masked shape (the open step) uses `--shadow-shape`, a drop-shadow filter.
Media gets an inset hairline (`--media-outline`) so white images keep their edge. Never a border
and a shadow on the same element.

## Shapes

`--radius-sm` (6px) for controls, thumbnails and small marks; `--radius` (10px) for cards, frames
and panels. A segmented track is 8px around 6px segments. Circles only for status dots, round play
and nav buttons. A dashed border means empty or a draft.

## Components

- **Button** `.btn`: white with a shadow border; `--primary` near-black fill; `--mini` small;
  `--icon` square. Presses scale to 0.97. Toggle buttons use `aria-pressed`. Small controls are
  `--control-h-sm` (26px) tall, the rest `--control-h` (32px).
- **Segmented control** `.chips`: a `--fill` track; the selected segment is white and
  raised. Used for clip takes and plan versions.
- **Rail** `.rail`: the current page's icon is white and raised like a selected segment; the brand picker shows
  the brand's initials on `--fill` (workspace and brand on hover), one select over it, brands grouped by workspace.
- **Step bar** `.flow-steps`: the steps in one `--fill` track like a segmented control, a faint chevron between
  each; the open step is a white arrow with rounded corners pointing on (`--shadow-shape`); steps not started are
  `--faint`. No status dots.
- **Markdown editor** `.mde`: rendered markdown, edited as it reads: a clicked block or table cell becomes editable
  in place (bold, italic, links, lists), framed by a hairline (a cell by a 1.5px `--fg` frame with `--radius-sm`,
  floating a little past its edges); a labeled line edits as its title and its text; only comments edit as raw text. Grips (`--faint`) sit in a margin outside the content and show on hover: left of a block; for a table, the
  hovered column's in a strip above the header, the hovered row's in a left gutter.
  A 2px `--fg` line marks where a drag drops; hovering a grip shades its row or column. A clicked grip selects its block, row or column (`--fill`) and opens a
  floating menu (`--shadow-float`), Delete last under a hairline. A script table ends with its word count and spoken time
  (estimated, or the voice take's own length once there is one), each after a muted icon; the hook in that sentence is
  a bold word that opens a list; one mini button on its
  right is the voice: Generate voice, then play / pause with the time ("0:12 / 2:09"), Regenerate voice once the script
  changes; no player controls. Selected text gets a floating Comment button; notes on the text list
  beside it past a full-height hairline, like the editor's, their quotes marked with `--fill-strong` and an underline.
- **Footage step** `.ft-*`: a `--fill` verdict box, then one row per scene: its clip (sticky, a dashed empty frame
  when missing) beside the scene name, a status dot once called, a ticked count, and its checks as shadow-bordered
  cards, then Approve / Reshoot mini buttons. A card is a check box beside what was asked, over its thread.
  Result icons (passed, the edit fixes it, reshoot) are `--muted`, never status colors.
- **Check box** `.check`: 18px, white with a shadow border, `--radius-sm`; ticked, a `--fg` fill with a white tick.
- **Thread** `.ft-thread`: chat messages, `--radius` with the tail corner `--radius-sm`: the AI and the agent on the
  left on `--bg-subtle`, the user on the right on `--fill-strong`; a `--faint` Comment link beside the latest.
- **Input / select** `.input` `.select` `.field`: 32px, 1px `--line` border that darkens on hover.
- **Badge** `.badge`: status dot and word. **Pill mark** `.pill-mark`: a `--fill` tag.
- **Media card** (Board and Media): a media frame at the render's own ratio; name, ID or status show
  on hover over a dark fade. Media cards add select and action buttons on hover.
- **Media frame** `.media-frame`: media on `--media-bg` with the inset hairline; zooms 2% on hover.
- **Details** `.param`: side panels list everything as a small muted label over its value, grouped
  by space, never by dividers. Copy buttons show on hover.
- **Viewer** `.vw`: on `--bg-subtle`, three rows on the left, nothing floating over the media: a top row of
  buttons (Close, prev/next, the page's tools), the media (full height or full width), and a player's controls
  in a row under it, each row past a hairline; 420px panel on the right. Prev/next wrap around at the ends. An ad with several versions gets a
  segmented V1 · V2 … switch in the top bar (and Feed · Story when a version has both); its card says how many.
- **Player** `Player.js`: every video and audio uses Studio's own controls, never the browser's:
  play, the time and progress in one pill, mute, the guides and full screen, each its own round or pill control.
  Media blocks in a doc (`compact`) drop mute and the guides. In a viewer they sit in a
  row under the picture; on an inline video they are a row across its bottom edge, shown only while the pointer is on it. Clicking the picture plays or pauses.
  In the viewers: Space plays / pauses; once a video is started, ← / → step one frame (Shift: 5 s),
  otherwise they and ↑ / ↓ move between files. Library videos mark scene cuts on the progress bar
  (hover shows that moment's frame, time and scene) and show their transcript as captions (toggle);
  library audio shows its waveform and transcript (the word being said lit) above the controls.
  The guide button cycles overlays on any video or image, and on the editor's preview: the 4:5 and 1:1
  feed crops it can be cut to, then (9:16 only) Meta's Reels safe zone, then off.
- **Trim panel** `.trim`: a floating panel above the editor's timeline: the clip's picture, its whole source as two
  strips (frames, waveform), and the part it plays as a dark-edged selection over both to drag (edges, or the middle
  to slide); letting go plays the new cut.
- **Notice** `.notice`: a `--fill` box in a side panel, for something to act on (an unnamed person to name).
- **Toast** `.toast`: near-black, bottom center, slides up 6px.
- **Focus**: always visible, `--focus-ring`.

## Motion

Only to show a change of state; nothing animates on page load. Ease-out (`--ease-out`): `--dur`
150ms for color, shadow and hover reveals, `--dur-press` 120ms for presses, `--dur-enter` 180ms for
a panel or toast appearing and the media zoom. Animate transform and opacity, never `all`.
Everything stops under reduced motion.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do use the `:root` variables; add one there before using a new value.
- Do keep color for status; show selection with the raised segment.
- Do put long text in the viewer panel and keep lists to one line per field.
- Don't add gradients, tints, colored icon backgrounds or a second accent.
- Don't add a second font, a third radius, or a border plus a shadow.
- Don't let the interface compete with the ads: no decoration, icons 13–16px and muted.
